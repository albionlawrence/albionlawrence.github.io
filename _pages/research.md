## Overview

I divide my time between topics relevant to planetary climate and topics in quantum field theory and quantum gravity

## Planetary Climates

I am a member of the [Geophysics and Astrophysics](https://www.brandeis.edu/physics/research/astrophysics.html) group at Brandeis, and a Visiting Associate of [Environmental Science and Engineering](https://ese.caltech.edu/) at Caltech.

### Current advisees

- Dr. Jack Skinner (PhD 2022, Queen Mary University). Joint Brandeis-Caltech postdoc (co-advised by [J%ouml;rn Callies](https://jcallies.com/) ) working on novel analysis techniques for satellite altimetry.

### Physical Oceanography

- Analysis and interpretation of satellite altimetry data
- Upper ocean turbulence
- Near-Inertial Waves and Internal Gravity Waves

### Geophysical Fluid Dynamics

- Novel characterizations of geophysical turbulence
- Hamiltonian methods
- Field theory techniques

## Quantum Field theory and Quantum Gravity

I am a member of the [Quantum and Gravitational Theory Group](https://www.brandeis.edu/physics/hegt/) at Brandeis.

### Current advisees

- Martin Sasieta (PhD 2022, IFT Madrid), Postdoc.
- Connor Wolfe, PhD student.

### Quantum information and quantum gravity

- Open quantum systems
- Entanglement of non-spatial degrees of freedom
- Quantum Black Holes
- Gauge/gravity duality

### Quantum Field Theory and Cosmology

- Axion models of inflation
- Quantum field theory of inflation
- Constraints and effects of quantum gravity on models of cosmology and particle physics
